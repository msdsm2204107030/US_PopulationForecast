# US_PopulationForecast
US Population data forecasting using Time Series Models

Context:
This project utilizes a dataset from the U.S. Census Bureau, accessible via the Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED). FRED's data platform hosts a variety of economic and demographic datasets, including those provided by the U.S. Census Bureau. The U.S. Census Bureau organization page on Kaggle offers additional data sources for comprehensive exploration. The dataset is updated daily, ensuring access to the most recent demographic information for analysis.

Problem Statement:
Understanding population dynamics is crucial for urban planning, resource allocation, and policymaking. Time series analysis of population data allows us to track demographic trends, forecast future population growth, and identify patterns that can inform decision-making processes. This project uses time series data analysis techniques to analyze population trends and provide insights into demographic changes over time.

Methodology:
We will be applying 5 different models on the complete dataset then based on the best outcome in terms of efficiency score, will select the final one.
The methodology for analyzing population time series data involves the following steps:

Data Collection: Gather a comprehensive dataset of population records over time from reliable sources such as government databases, census data, or international organizations. Ensure the dataset covers a significant time span to capture long-term trends and variations.

Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the population data to ensure accuracy and consistency. This may include handling missing values, outlier detection, and removal, and ensuring uniformity in time intervals. Data cleaning techniques such as interpolation or imputation may be applied as necessary.

Time Series Decomposition: Decompose the population time series into its constituent components, including trend, seasonality, and noise. This step helps in identifying underlying patterns and understanding the factors driving population changes.

Statistical Analysis: Conduct statistical analysis to characterize the population trends and variations. Explore descriptive statistics, such as mean, median, and standard deviation, to summarize the population data. Additionally, analyse autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions to identify temporal dependencies and trends.

Model Selection: Choose appropriate time series models to capture and forecast population dynamics. Common models include ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average), SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA), and exponential smoothing models. Select the model that best fits the data based on model diagnostics and goodness-of-fit criteria.

Model Training and Validation: Split the population dataset into training and validation sets. Train the selected time series model on the training data and validate its performance using the validation set. Fine-tune model parameters and evaluate forecasting accuracy using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

Forecasting: Use the trained time series model to forecast future population trends. Generate forecasts for multiple time horizons and assess the uncertainty associated with the predictions. Visualize the forecasted population trends along with prediction intervals to convey the range of possible outcomes.

Interpretation and Insights: Interpret the results of the population trend analysis and extract actionable insights. Identify key drivers of population change, such as birth rates, mortality rates, migration patterns, and socio-economic factors. Provide recommendations for policymakers, urban planners, and stakeholders based on the findings of the analysis.

DATASET:
This is a U.S. Census Bureau dataset that the Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED) is hosting. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/ will take you to the FRED data platform, where they update their information based on the volume of data they receive.

URL for the dataset in Kaggle we are using : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/census/population-time-series-data/data 

This dataset has a total of 4 columns: 'realtime_start', 'value', 'date', 'realtime_end'

Here ‘value’ demonstrates the population in that date. ‘date’ represents the date in which the population was recorded. We have a total of 816 records with a mean population of 243847. 

Some other measures which represent the dataset are given below:
std	50519.140567
min	156309.000000
25%	201725.250000
50%	239557.500000
75%	289364.250000
max	330309.946000

This is a monthly data and starts from 1st Jan 1952 till 1st December 2019.
This dataset is maintained using FRED's API and Kaggle's API.

Expected Outcome:

Accurate Population Forecasts:  Accurate projections of future population trends should be provided by the time series analysis, allowing stakeholders to foresee changes in the population and make appropriate plans.

Identification of Key Drivers: The analysis should identify significant factors influencing population dynamics, allowing for targeted interventions and policy measures to address demographic challenges.

Visualization of Trends: Visual representations, such as time series plots and forecasted trajectories, should effectively communicate population trends and variations over time.

Evaluation of Forecast Accuracy: The forecasting model's performance should be evaluated using appropriate metrics to assess its accuracy and reliability in predicting population dynamics.
